<!-- - Reference for [Android application](/XClipper.Android). -->

## Features

Originally inspired from [Ditto](https://ditto-cp.sourceforge.io/) which offers great features out of the box. No doubt it is the best application but sometimes it makes it even more confusing when using an application with more features. (_Just my thinking, no offense_)

- Clean & **beautiful** UI.
- **Easier** to use and manage.
- Password Protection for Database, [learn more](https://github.com/KaustubhPatange/XClipper/wiki/Password-Protect-Database).
- Database syncing between devices, [learn more](https://github.com/KaustubhPatange/XClipper/wiki/Data-Synchronization).
- Similar features like ditto & Lot more... _but just leaving it here_.

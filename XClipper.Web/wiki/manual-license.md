> This method can be used in case if your transaction is completed but the license is not activated.

> If you want to know why can't you activate XClipper from the mobile application. Read this [FAQ](https://github.com/KaustubhPatange/XClipper/wiki/FAQs#q-why-pc-application-is-a-single-source-of-truth).

## Steps

- [Getting your transaction Id](#getting-your-transaction-id)
- [Activating the License](#activating-the-license)

### Getting your transaction Id

So the payment is carried out through PayPal from XClipper [website](https://kaustubhpatange.github.io/XClipper/). That means your transaction is saved in your PayPal purchase history.

- Login to the paypal.com and select the appropriate transaction you made to purchase XClipper.
- On the top, you will see your "**Transaction ID**".

## Activating the License

- Once you find your "**Transaction ID**", right-click on XClipper from system tray > License Configuration.

- Enter the "**Transaction ID**" & select the Pricing category to "**Premium**". Click on the "**Activate**" button to validate your license.

- Once it's done, XClipper will be unlocked.

_Note: If it still doesn't unlock try restarting the application. Even that doesn't work you should contact me over my [mail](mailto:developerkp16@gmail.com)_.

> Your Unique Id is what determines the identity of your Windows copy. It will be used to verify the license on the system.

If somehow your UID changes XClipper will fail to activate license. In such case [read this article](https://github.com/KaustubhPatange/XClipper/wiki/Migrating-License) to migrate your existing license to new UID.

_Note: You cannot have a single license to be used on multiple desktop, but what you can have is one desktop application & multiple connected mobile devices. Read more about this behavior in the [FAQ](https://github.com/KaustubhPatange/XClipper/wiki/FAQs#q-why-pc-application-is-a-single-source-of-truth)_.

## Working through

- Right-click XClipper application from system tray > License Configuration (as shown below).

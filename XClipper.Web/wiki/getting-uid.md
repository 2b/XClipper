> Your Unique Id is what determines the identity of your Windows copy. It will be used to verify the license on the system.

If somehow your UID changes your XClipper will not be activated. In such case [read this article](https://github.com/KaustubhPatange/XClipper/wiki/Migrating-License) to migrate your existing license to new UID.

_Note: You cannot have a single license used on multiple desktops, but what you can have is one desktop application & multiple mobile connected devices. Read more about this behavior in the [FAQ]()_.

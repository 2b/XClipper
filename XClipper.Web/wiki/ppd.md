**_The feature is available in donated version, [see how to activate it](https://github.com/KaustubhPatange/XClipper/wiki/Purchasing-License)_**.

- This feature encrypts the XClipper database with a password.

If you've noticed, all the clips are stored in file **data.db** on your local computer. By using some third-party tools you can easily view their contents other than using XClipper.

If you don't want to make this happen, you can always encrypt the database with a password using this feature. XClipper can only open the database when you provide it a one-time password.

## Working through

- Right-click **XClipper** icon in the _system tray_ to open options menu.
- Now navigate to Settings (_a new window will be displayed_).
- **_Check_** Protect database with encryption.
- Use a _custom password_ or keep the default one.
- Once set click on **Save** button, a migration task will be performed and then you can close the Settings window.

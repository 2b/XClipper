**_To pay using GPay follow this [guide](#using-google-pay)_**

The following features will be unlocked when you buy the license.

- _**Password** protect the database, [learn more](https://github.com/KaustubhPatange/XClipper/wiki/Password-Protect-Database)_
- _Support development_ ‚ù§Ô∏è

## Why to Buy?

Well, it shows your love towards **open source** development. I could've made this as **closed source** application, but since I am a huge fan of **OSS** (Open-sourced software) I want to keep it open so that other developers can read and learn from this. (_I mean that's what I do_).

Anyway at the end of day its all your decision, but each purchase will boost me more to work on this project.

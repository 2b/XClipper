> Your XClipper "**UID**" is the key for determining a valid license. In case it changes (for eg: re-installing windows or migrating to new PC) your activation will fail.

> In such case you need to _migrate_ your license information to the new UID.

## Steps

- [Finding your transaction Id](#finding-your-transaction-id)
- [Migrating existing license](#migrating-existing-license)

### Finding your transaction Id

> Find the transaction you made through PayPal for purchasing the XClipper license for the first time.

- Login to paypal.com & find the transaction.
- There you need to copy "**Transaction ID**" which will be used in the next step.
- You will also need the _Transaction Date_ as the other parameter.

### Migrating existing license

- Right-click & open XClipper application from system tray > License configurations (as shown below).

- Select the "**Migration**" tab & enter the required information.
- Once done click on the "**Migrate**" button to start the process. XClipper will then activate your license for the current PC on a successful response.
